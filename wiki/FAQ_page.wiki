== What if the mote emulation in COOJA does not work as in the real motes? == 

This could be because there are some incomplete, incorrect or missing drivers in MSPsim. Debugging MSPsim is pretty straightforward if you know a bit of Java and know how to use printfs. 

You have to download MSPsim to your machine by doing the following:
{{{
cd ~
cd local/src
git clone https://github.com/mspsim/mspsim
}}}

Then, you can go and modify the drivers you need to modify. For example, the CC2420 driver is located in the folder "se/sics/mspsim/chip"

Do your required modification in the file then open a terminal inside the  main folder of MSPsim and type 
{{{
ant jar
}}}
this command will compile the new code and create a .jar file.
Copy the .jar file and place it in the following folder "YOUR_CONTIKI_FOLDER/tools/mspsim". Then just run COOJA again to test your new driver!

== What there is a driver in MSPsim that is incomplete, incorrect or missing?==

If this is the case, we would really appreciate that you let us know f you are planning to use MSP430 motes (Telosb, sky, CM5000, Z1, etc.), installing MSPsim may be handy as COOJA uses it to simulate these motes. *_This is only necessary_* if you plan to develop MSP430 drivers that are missing or update the existing drivers. You can download MSPsim as follows:
{{{
cd ~
cd local/src
git clone https://github.com/mspsim/mspsim
}}}

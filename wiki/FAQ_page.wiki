= Frequently Asked Questions =

== What do I need in order to use GISOO? == 

You will need to have:

* A machine running either Linux or Windows
* [http://www.mathworks.se/products/matlab/ MATLAB], [http://www.mathworks.se/products/simulink/ Simulink] and the  [[http://www.mathworks.se/products/xpctarget/ xPC Target] Simulink toolbox
* COOJA installed (comes with Contiki OS)
* TinyOS installed [optional] 


== What if the mote emulation in COOJA does not work as in the real motes? == 

This could be because there are some incomplete, incorrect or missing drivers in MSPsim. Please let us know if this happens to you so we can be aware of it. Debugging MSPsim is pretty straightforward if you know a bit of Java and know how to use printfs. 

You have to download MSPsim to your machine by doing the following:
{{{
cd ~
cd local/src
git clone https://github.com/mspsim/mspsim
}}}

Then, you can go and modify the drivers you need to modify. For example, the CC2420 driver is located in the folder "se/sics/mspsim/chip"

Do your required modification in the file then open a terminal inside the  main folder of MSPsim and type 
{{{
ant jar
}}}
this command will compile the new code and create a .jar file.
Copy the .jar file and place it in the following folder "YOUR_CONTIKI_FOLDER/tools/mspsim". Then just run COOJA again to test your new driver!

== What there is a driver in MSPsim that is incomplete, incorrect or missing?==

Please let us know if this happens to you so we can be aware of it. If this is the case, you have to install MSPsim and either fix MSPsim, or develop your new driver. Please check "What if the mote emulation in COOJA does not work as in the real motes?" for more information on how to install and compile MSPsim.

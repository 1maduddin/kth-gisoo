= Overview =
Since GISOO is an integration of Simulink and Cooja, it is necessary to create different parts of our desired system in the following manner:
  *Physical system (Plant) should be modelled in Simulink.
  *Sensors, Actuator, Relays and their Wireless communication will be created in Cooja.
  *Controller can be located in Simulink or Cooja.

You can find more details about each steps in following:
 == Cooja preparation ==
For preparing the Cooja, we have to execute it and create a new simulation including our required motes. Finally we must connect the sensors, actuators and all of the motes which need serial communication to the same motes in Simulink. These steps has been explained in below:
 === Cooja Execution  ===
For executing the Cooja first we should open a shell window of Cygwin and change the directory to the  Cooja directory. In this sample, the Cygwin has been located in the C:\\cygwin\  and contiki folder which contains the Cooja is located in the C:\\contiki-2.6\ . You can see the needed commands for changing the directories in the picture. Finally in the cooja folder you should use the “ant run” command to execute it.

 === Create a new simulation ===
Excuting the cooja, we should create a new simulation environment which can be done from the file menu as has been shown in the picture:

In the window of new simulation creator, you can select a name for your simulation and select your desired radio medium. You can also select the random seed for your simulation which should be the same if you want to reload exactly the same simulation. The "Create new simulation" window has been shown below:

In the result of the mentioned steps the new simulation environment will be created such as following picture:

=== Adding motes to the simulation ===
After creating the new simulation environment we have to add all the motes to the simulation. Although Cooja supports different types of motes and operating systems, we used Sky Mote and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyOS TinyOS] in all of our experiments and all the available codes have been developed in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NesC nesC] (for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TinyOS TinyOS]).

Inorder to add a new mote to the simulation you can use the Motes menu and follow the "Motes->Add motes->Create new mote type->Sky mote" as it has been shown in the following picture:

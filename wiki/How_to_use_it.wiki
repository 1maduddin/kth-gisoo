Since GISOO is an integration of Simulink and Cooja, it is necessary to create different parts of our desired system in the following manner:
  *Physical system (Plant) should be modelled in Simulink.
  *Sensors, Actuator, Relays and their Wireless communication will be created in Cooja.
  *Controller can be located in Simulink or Cooja.

You can find more details about each steps in following:
 == Cooja preparation ==
For preparing the Cooja, we have to execute it and create a new simulation including our required motes. Finally we must connect the sensors, actuators and all of the motes which need serial communication to the same motes in Simulink. These steps has been explained in below:
 === Cooja Execution  ===
For executing the Cooja first we should open a shell window of Cygwin and change the directory to the  Cooja directory. In this sample, the Cygwin has been located in the C:\\cygwin\  and contiki folder which contains the Cooja is located in the C:\\contiki-2.6\ . You can see the needed commands for changing the directories in the picture. Finally in the cooja folder you should use the “ant run” command to execute it.

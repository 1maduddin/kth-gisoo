= Samples Overview =
This section provide explanation about different sample scenarios. The scenarios have been selected so that they cover different areas of projects. At the beginning it has been tried to show how can use the ADC and DAC in GISOO and in the next step the required details foe serial communication has been explained and the usage of serial communication has been shown in a simple example. In the next step the the previous simple scenario has been extended to show the usage of CTP routing protocol in the routing layer. 

== Serial Communication ==
More over to ADC and DAC, GISOO also supports the Serial communication between Simulink and Cooja. This facility make it possible to simulate those systems with the need of powerful processing resource as a  controller. In this situation by using a motes with a "BaseStasion" application which can act as a gateway we can transfer our collected data to a PC where the controlling computation will be done and finally the results can be send back via the serial communication to the wireless system to be used in order to control the plant.

=== double-tank system with the controller on PC ===
In the section "[https://code.google.com/p/kth-gisoo/wiki/How_to_use_it , How to use GISOO] " we introduced the double-tank system as a "[https://code.google.com/p/kth-gisoo/wiki/How_to_use_it#Simple_Scenario, simple scenario]". In this section we explain the same simulation scenario but by locating the control process on a PC instead of a mote. The following picture shows both scenarios with controller in a mote or in a PC.

In order to simulate the scenario with the controller on PC first we should create all of our motes  in Cooja, so we should four motes: one Sensor, one relay, one Base-Station and, one actuator. You can download the TinyOS code for the motews from here (?????????????) these codes are exactly the same code as those we had for our simple scenario with the new message structure for the sensor and actuator and also instead of a code for controller we have a modified code for base-station which send the radio messages to the actuator instead of broadcast which will be explained in the following.  

==== Message structure for the serial communication in GISOO ====
The details od designed messages structure for data transmission between Simulink and Cooja in GISOO has been explained in (?????????????????). But in very short to understand this part we should know that GISOO has been designed so that for serial communication between Cooja and Simulink <b>the message should have the 16 byte structure </b>

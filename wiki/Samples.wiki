== Serial Communication ==
More over to ADC and DAC, GISOO also support the Serial communication between Simulink and Cooja. This facility make it possible to simulate system which needs a powerful processing resource for their controller. In this situation by using some motes with some standard application such as baseStasion as a gateway
